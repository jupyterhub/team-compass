# Funding and reimbursements

## Who can spend funds

Currently we do not have formal processes for approving funding, and we make decisions about where to spend funds similarly to [our other decision making processes](#prs:when-to-merge).

## Funds available to this project

### CZI Community Strategic Lead grant

We have a grant from CZI to fund a Community Strategic Lead position.
Find all of the grant materials, budget, etc at [this Google Drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Qk_6IvMwtS9F2yKzF4-wtrng6IJK7Dy6?usp=share_link).

### mybinder.org donations

The mybinder.org service has a button to send donations directly to NumFocus to support the project.
These funds are controlled directly by NumFocus and we must submit reimbursements to them in order to spend them.

To learn how much funds we have, send an e-mail to `finance@numfocus.org` to ask.

To spend these funds, see [](#funding:numfocus-reimbursement).
