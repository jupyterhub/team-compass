## Emoji keys

You may notice that some of the team-members have "emojis" to reflect their
contributions in JupyterHub. These are from the [Kent Dodds "all contributors spec"](https://allcontributors.org/).
Below is a short table to show what each emoji represents.

## Outreachy internships

We would also like to thank everybody who has participated in Outreachy
internships with us. This includes the interns themselves who worked with us to
improve JupyterHub, and the community members that donated their time and skills
as mentors, coordinators and volunteers.
