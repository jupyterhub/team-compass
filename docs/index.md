Our Team Compass contains team practices, policies, and resources to help one another align and contribute.
It also has helpful information for team members, like shared infrastructure and accounts, resources to learn how to contribute, etc.

We use **[GitHub issues in `jupyterhub/team-compass`](https://github.com/jupyterhub/team-compass/issues)**
to discuss specific, actionable things related to the *team* (e.g., discussing whether to change something in the team-compass repo).

The following pages contain information about the JupyterHub/Binder
teams, resources for community members, and team practices for
governance and planning.

## Why have a Team Compass?

This repository helps the JupyterHub team and Binder team align on our structure, policy, and goals.
Our primary goal is continuous team and project improvement.

As projects and their growth evolve rapidly, the contents of this repo
should aid us in setting project direction and adjusting the course as
needed. The repo contains:

- team meeting agendas and archives
- direction and action plans
- communication and culture of respectful teamwork
- recognitions and team celebrations

## We sail together

While we value each others individual strengths and contributions, we succeed
or fail as a team. Whether taking corrective actions for a bug or being
recognized for good work, the team, instead of an individual, shoulders
the burden and success.

## Code of Conduct

The JupyterHub community follows the broader [Jupyter Community's Code of Conduct](https://github.com/jupyter/governance/blob/master/conduct/code_of_conduct.md).
