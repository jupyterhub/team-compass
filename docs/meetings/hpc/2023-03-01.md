## Quick updates

60 second updates on things you have been up to, questions you have, or developments you think people should know about. This is also a chance to suggest a future presentation if you've got work currently in progress you might want to share. Please add yourself, and if you do not have an update to share, you can pass.

- **Name:** Your report or celebration
- Tunnel service
    - manage ssh tunnel from k8s cluster to JLab in HPC
    - not using sshspawner because spawning still goes through HPC scheduling system, cluster doesn't "trust" k8s resources
- Portwrap, [root issue](https://github.com/ryanlovett/portwrap/issues/6)
    - openssh errors out if config files aren't owned by root, userns masks this

## Reports and celebrations

This is a place to make announcements (without a need for discussion). This is also a great place to give shout-outs to contributors! We'll read through these at the beginning of the meeting.

## Agenda items

Let's collect all potential agenda items here before the start of the meeting. We will then attempt to create a coherent agenda that fits in the 60m meeting slot. If there are similar items try and group them together.

- **All:** Standing project items:
    - Batchspawner check-in: Issues and PRs
        - Plan was for new release this month
            - merged [PR #252](https://github.com/jupyterhub/batchspawner/pull/252) (test matrix updates)
            - tests succeeded as of last test run in branch, most failed on merge
            - difference seems to be due to another sqlalchemy update and (old) JHub using a deprecated feature
            - this keeps happening, investigating - thinking about how to pin versions so older test configs keep working
        - Issue [#191](https://github.com/jupyterhub/batchspawner/issues/191) - has anyone seen this error message before?
        - PR [#265](https://github.com/jupyterhub/batchspawner/pull/265) - seems reasonable, any objections?
    - Wrapspawner check-in: Issues and PRs
        - PR [#57](https://github.com/jupyterhub/wrapspawner/pull/57) [name=Mridul Seth] The `options_form` trait seems misconfigured ?
            - yes this seems like old code crud, could be removed
            - brings up once again that [we would like to see profiles feature upstreamed in Jupyterhub](https://github.com/jupyterhub/jupyterhub/issues/2724) see our own issue [#33](https://github.com/jupyterhub/wrapspawner/issues/33) as well
