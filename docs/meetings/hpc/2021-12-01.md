## Reports and celebrations

This is a place to make announcements (without a need for discussion). This is also a great place to give shout-outs to contributors! We'll read through these at the beginning of the meeting.

- **Name:** Your report or celebration
- [name=Min (not here)] [just published JupyterHub 2.0](https://blog.jupyter.org/jupyterhub-2-0-7a038715e96d)
    - woohoo!
    - RBAC (role-based access control): More fine grained permissions in the hub
    - How parameters are passed by the spawner, now environment variables only: may be a breaking change for some.  But it's a lot more future-proof
    - JupyterLab is the default

## Agenda items

Let's collect all potential agenda items here before the start of the meeting. We will then attempt to create a coherent agenda that fits in the 60m meeting slot. If there are similar items try and group them together.
 
- **All:** Standing project items:
    - Batchspawner check-in: Issues and PRs
    - Wrapspawner check-in: Issues and PRs
        - https://github.com/jupyterhub/wrapspawner/issues/44
        - Having to vivify the `self.child_spawner.server`
        - Action:
            - Start a PR to fix this (Rollin will)
            - Tag all relevant issues in that PR
            - Have discussion in the PR about this to see if there's a better fix 
- JupyterHub 2.0 tests
    - Felix tested w/BatchSpawner.  Didn't need any code changes to work!  How encouraging!
    - Folks will test with WrapSpawner
- JupyterLab 3 and Batchspawner - status?
    - Need to redo how we do singleuser launch?
    - https://jupyterhub.readthedocs.io/en/stable/reference/config-user-env.html#switching-back-to-classic-notebook
- Notebook servers on login nodes
    - Can you put remote kernels on compute nodes
    - Use kernel gateway to connect
    - BatchSpawner for this?
        - Not set out to support this...
        - Could be modified
    - Job would run kernel gateway
    - Lab needs to know how to find it
    - What if there are multiple jobs running
    - Felix suggests:
        - Notebook on the login node
        - Job is running another notebook server for the kernels
        - Could be hacked, but is this a thing?
    - ~~sshkernenl?: https://github.com/NII-cloud-operation/sshkernel~~ not relevant
