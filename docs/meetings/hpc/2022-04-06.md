## Reports and celebrations

This is a place to make announcements (without a need for discussion). This is also a great place to give shout-outs to contributors! We'll read through these at the beginning of the meeting.

## Agenda items

Let's collect all potential agenda items here before the start of the meeting. We will then attempt to create a coherent agenda that fits in the 60m meeting slot. If there are similar items try and group them together.

- EPA team - discuss work and contribution to Wrapspawner
    - Jeff works at EPA on high-end computing
    - Working to add new feature to JupyterHub
        - Similar to profilespawner
        - Profiles for launching jobs come from file system
        - They use slurm, central scripts storage
        - Allow users to store their own
        - Form allows users to alter script
        - Some javascript
        - Want to contribute to wrapspawner
        - Erik's suggested related reading on how to adjust spawn options based on user input which could be relevant for the most detailed customizations: https://discourse.jupyter.org/t/tailoring-spawn-options-and-server-configuration-to-certain-users/8449
        - Question is whether these are just Jupyter notebook jobs, or other kinds of jobs
    - Submit PR!
        - Bringing in stuff from the filesystem, keep in mind that in many deployments, the filesystem where users do their work is not accessible from where JupyterHub is running
        - Read-only mount?
        - Filesystem part is configurable
- **All:** Standing project items:
    - Batchspawner check-in: Issues and PRs
        - need to check CI status, seems to be failing for PRs, from March:
            - pytest run for 3.9 against hub 0.9.6 fails
            - using a deprecated sqlalchemy maybe pinned by hub
            - Plan: drop that combo from the matrix, rerun
            - https://github.com/jupyterhub/batchspawner/pull/229
            - Will probably unblock other failed PR tests
        - Worthwhile to do a sweep on batchspawner PRs
            - Which are worth keeping which to close?
            - Plan: Mike will take a look on PRs
        - Some new pull requests
        - Users have been breaking batchspawner by overwriting the script template
            - Created issue to not encourage users to do this
            - Documentation issue, not code issue
            - Some better config examples for README (they're old)
    - Wrapspawner check-in: Issues and PRs
        - None
- Workshop/conference season:
    - ISC 22 Interactive HPC
        - https://www.interactivehpc.com
        - Accepting late submissions
        - Author notification: April 14, 2022
        - 6-12 page papers, also "paper drafting exercise"
    - SC 22 Urgent+Interactive HPC workshop accepted
    - PEARC in Boston
        - Short deadline for posters + papers April 8 NO EXTENSION
- DaskGateway maintenance push
    - Looking to connect and overview usage Slurm and PBS in general and if DaskGateway is used
    - Most people on the call are running or running on Slurm
    - Erik's been working on CI testing against e.g. Slurm
        - Docker containers
        - Had been outdated so Erik's modernizing
        - See links below about CI and Slurm
    - Notes from Rollin/NERSC:
        - Background:
            - We use Slurm to schedule jobs
            - Main back-end for DaskGateway on Slurm is dask-jobqueue
            - dask-jobqueue submits (IIRC) single-node jobs to start workers
            - Our policies prevent more than 2 jobs per user from accruing priority at any given time
            - Access to fast startup (which is expected by users) needs to be managed carefully
            - CLI access to talk to Slurm
        - A better fit for us:
            - Submit a single job with all the nodes you'll need
            - Start scheduler and srun workers inside that job
            - On one machine dask-mpi is the most stable way to launch
            - On another, vanilla scheduler + dask-cuda-workers is fine
            - Always want scheduler and workers in the compute nodes, only client running in Jupyter
        - Another issue is DaskGateway is specific to Dask
            - We have Spark, IPyParallel, Ray users too
            - But we do want the _general_ gateway functionality of:
                - Taking a user request for a cluster runtime
                - Templating that into a batch job with all the right settings and optimizations
                - Having a way to connect to that from a notebook
                - AND get the environments to match up (between the notebook and the cluster)
                    - Needs to support both bare metal and containers
            - Our center has its own API and we're adding templating as a service
                - Plan lets us support Jupyter + generic cluster runtime
                - Lets us optimize and manage how the jobs run
    - About CI to run Slurm:
        - A large PR updating Dockerfile's that initializes Slurm in a container: https://github.com/dask/dask-gateway/pull/519
        - The old Dockerfile that builds to a image that starts Slurm: https://github.com/dask/dask-gateway/blob/main/continuous_integration/docker/slurm/Dockerfile
        - The new Dockerfile after updating it in my PR: https://github.com/dask/dask-gateway/blob/d6cdf3304cd84753811ae99574caf89e1abb9b36/continuous_integration/docker/slurm/Dockerfile
