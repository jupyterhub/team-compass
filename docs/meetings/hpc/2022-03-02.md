## Agenda items

- NumFOCUS Community Events manager intro: Gayle
    - Jupyter Steering Council created [Community Building Committee](https://jupyter.org/governance/communitybuildingcommittee.html)
    - Jupyter Community Workshops and JupyterCon
    - Needed to find someone who could handle community events: Gayle!

- **All:** Standing project items:
    - Batchspawner check-in: Issues and PRs
        - need to check CI status, seems to be failing for PRs
            - pytest run for 3.9 against hub 0.9.6 fails
            - using a deprecated sqlalchemy maybe pinned by hub
            - Plan: drop that combo from the matrix, rerun
            - https://github.com/jupyterhub/batchspawner/pull/229
            - Will probably unblock other failed PR tests
        - Worthwhile to do a sweep on batchspawner PRs
            - Which are worth keeping which to close?
            - Plan: Mike will take a look on PRs
    - Wrapspawner check-in: Issues and PRs
        - https://github.com/jupyterhub/wrapspawner/issues/44
            - PR: https://github.com/jupyterhub/wrapspawner/pull/50
                - This PR was approved by Simon and reviewed by Min
                - Min suggested explicitly linking `server` property
            - PR: https://github.com/jupyterhub/wrapspawner/pull/51
                - PR created in response to Min's suggestion
                - Compare 50 and 51 and decide on course of action?
            - Also note:
                - https://github.com/jupyterhub/jupyterhub/pull/3810
                - This may help resolve the issue as well (unconfirmed)
            - Plan:
                - Accept 51 to support older JupyterHub than 2.1.1
                - Do a point release in a month or so
        - 1.0.1 release in light of https://github.com/jupyterhub/wrapspawner/pull/45: Done
