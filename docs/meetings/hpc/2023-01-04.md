## Agenda items

Let's collect all potential agenda items here before the start of the meeting. We will then attempt to create a coherent agenda that fits in the 60m meeting slot. If there are similar items try and group them together.

    - Batchspawner check-in: Issues and PRs
        - Still to-do from previous months:
            - PR updating test matrix - https://github.com/jupyterhub/batchspawner/pull/252
            - Docs fixing (not overriding master templates)
        - Merge fix for JupyterHub 3 compatibility in singleuser?
            - e.g. https://github.com/jupyterhub/batchspawner/pull/247
            - Ryan is running this in production w/Hub 3 for a while
    - Wrapspawner check-in: Issues and PRs
        - Quiet
- Advertising
    - Should HPC be its own subproject or some kind of more official interest group?
    - Broadening beyond Hub is happening
- Workshop/conference news:
    - JupyterCon 2023
        - Cite des Sciences, Paris 
        - May 10-12
        - https://www.jupytercon.com/
        - CfP ended December 20
    - PEARC 2023 CfP is out
        - papers/short papers due March/April
- Abandoned things to revive/decide fate of?
    - https://github.com/jupyterhub/research-facilities
    - https://github.com/jupyterhub/jupyterhub-deploy-hpc
    - Jupyter (not just hub) in HPC subproject?
        - Rollin will look at this in January for Feb meeting
- Request for assistance/guidance on jupyterhub-singleuser/portwrap integration (ryanlovett)
    - Mike and Ryan will talk offline
    - portwrap is a CLI with command you want put in a namespace
    - somewhere in the config instead of invoking jupyter, you could just run portwrap
        - But it wants to run jupyterhub-singleuser
        - How to configure the actual command that jupyterhub-singleuser invokes
    - Ryan now thinks he has a way forward
- Announcements from the jupyterhub-announcement service can appear in JupyterLab too:
    - https://github.com/rcthomas/jupyterhub-announcement
    - https://github.com/Josh0823/nersc-refresh-announcements
- Ryan: stopping a spawned server, https://github.com/jupyterhub/jupyterhub/issues/2975
    - Michael - looking at user.py in Hub 2 vs Hub 3 seems like there may be different behavior, which would explain why this group has different experiences here
