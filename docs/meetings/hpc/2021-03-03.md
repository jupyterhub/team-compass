## Agenda items

Let's collect all potential agenda items here before the start of the meeting. We will then attempt to create a coherent agenda that fits in the 60m meeting slot. If there are similar items try and group them together.

- JupyterLab-Xpra integration (Jens):
    - NoMachine/VNC++ thing in the browser
    - Builds on top of jupyter-server-proxy
    - Opened an issue on jupyter-server-proxy
    - Main purpose is for Paraview
    - Makes it easier for people to get started from nothing
    - Mainly something like tutorials
    - There's also TigerVNC integration via jupyter-desktop-server -- Felix
        - Jens likes the xpra performance better
        - Clicks handled right away, VNC too laggy
    - https://github.com/FZJ-JSC/jupyter-xprahtml5-proxy
- MATLAB
    - JupyterLab extension
    - https://github.com/mathworks/jupyter-matlab-proxy
    - Anyone feel free to test, Felix is talking to Mathworks about testing it since he has a lot of users
- MIG (multi-instance GPU, NVIDIA)
    - Can address "GPUs cannot be shared but must be shared"
    - Integration with Slurm is still in the works
    - https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/technologies/multi-instance-gpu/
- Standing Items:
    - Batchspawner check-in
        - Autoformat PR:
            - Richard will have a response to the PR
            - Might be next month before doing something...
    - Wrapspawner check-in
- JupyterLab 3 migrations (Rollin):
    - At NERSC kind of holding on jupyterlab-git
    - Upgrading our extensions (recents, favorites, slurm)
    - Migration tool helps but doesn't handle everything
    - May push upgrade to April instead of March
