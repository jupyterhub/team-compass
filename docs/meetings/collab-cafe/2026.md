### Notes for JupyterHub Roadmapping workshop

* [https://github.com/jupyterhub/team-compass/issues/805](https://github.com/jupyterhub/team-compass/issues/805) 
* there are 3 big timeslots we would like to plan an agenda for
* when do we want breakout rooms? when do we want everyone in a sync room together?
* what's the purpose for maintainers and deployers as a source of info? 
* what should we populate the roadmap with? 
* discussing the purpose of the workshop
  * this feels like we should involve everyone
  * defines the parameters of the workshop, e.g. what is a roadmap
* 2 days: 1. what is a roadmap, 2. populate the roadmap
  * theme 1: priorities?
  * theme 2: process?
* folks involved with TREs tend to be based in EU
* ask people to prep priorities in advance and host a discussion group during the sync time? i.e. unconference style
  * possibly some project management here, how to break tasks down
* or traditional approach: put them on a post-it, rank and then order? 
* resources and capacity should inform what should be on the roadmap? We are not top-down, we are a collection of people with needs, goals, and varied availability
* it shouldn't be a to-do list, could have "side-quests" in terms of communicating priorities
* roadmap is not a linear path
  * what questions do we want to answer?
  * deployers might want to know next release
  * contributors: where can i direct my time?
* circulate who's who ahead of the meeting, that might help identify personas and themes for roadmap
  * virtual participants might appreciate maybe a slide deck to share around, so we know who's in the room ahead of time
    * [https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1RRPqdKtNWmK1sBrYzKB0tnUJfpf5avw8s8NxlmkjWrQ/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1RRPqdKtNWmK1sBrYzKB0tnUJfpf5avw8s8NxlmkjWrQ/edit?usp=sharing) (copied from another workshop)
* Day 1: purpose of the roadmap, proposals on how we approach that, e.g. how to keep it up to date, something that is useful for folks to look up easily,
* primary goal is to come out with a process that we can use for the community at large to continually engage with the roadmap and gather inputs, and design it in a way that fits people's interests and priorities
  * e.g. if folks are interested in security, then how does this fit with a shared roadmap?
  * useful to collect experiences from a project planning perspective and avoid common pitfalls
  * could do some skills matrix mapping ahead of time
* follow-up work after the workshop
* personal experiences with roadmaps
  * a public roadmap is not a project management tool, but a tool for helping to coalesce communities and stakeholders together to drive forward progress
  * if you have a team with resources, then this can be useful, but if you have a fragmented, overstretched team, then the roadmap tends to get ignored
* aspirational or practical?
  * difficulty * effort * priority
  * e.g. lots of effort but important tends to get left behind, idea for multiple replicas for hubs has been around for a while, but has not got traction
  * how to make this more visible for potential contributors so that they feel like they can tackle roadmap items?
* outcome of roadmap could help draw in funding from grants to buy people's time
* process could be to sort items into priority and resource buckets
  * how do we present and update this information easily?
  * will the community manager be able to help here?
* Next steps after this café: 
  * take the icebreaker slides away and prep them
  * invite some registered participants to future collab cafés to help discuss agenda

  * PR: [https://github.com/jupyter-book/mystmd/pull/2602](https://github.com/jupyter-book/mystmd/pull/2602)
* Accessibility
  * Had a pass early on in the project
  * Still needs work, opportunity for someone to take a lead on
  * There are a few low-hanging issues, such as color contrast
    * Cell errors don't meet color contrast requirements
    * Scroller issue ?
  * See also Silas's notes below

* 2026 big picture items
  * What is the most useful way for the community to help?
  * Execution initiative: [https://github.com/jupyter-book/mystmd/issues/2019](https://github.com/jupyter-book/mystmd/issues/2019)
  * We're still working on a good strategy for prioritizing and executing on issues

* Reminder: weekly work sessions (see [https://compass.jupyterbook.org/contribute/#events)](https://compass.jupyterbook.org/contribute/#events))
  * Wed 9am Pacific, and feel free to organize other sessions


* Yuvi demo: [https://github.com/yuvipanda/jupyterbook.pub/](https://github.com/yuvipanda/jupyterbook.pub/)
  * enter repo (does not need to be GH) and static files for a book are deployed (magic?)
  * yuvi has 5 hrs into this tool and wants input from JB users to know where to take it further
  * ideas:
    * from demo chat: helping with PR review, preserving older/alternative versions of books, ...
    * ability to edit/modify static files after build?
    * regarding execution of source code during book build (e.g., executing cells of a nb); is that possible, and if so how; if it needs a handoff to some compute engine how would that work?
    * use case for a user training: participants edit content, use tool, view book. should be straightforward way to see all of the "version" (perhaps by commit for new users?) and manage how many are preserved? Perhaps a sort of "refresh" button type of feature that jumps to the build from the most recent commit from a repo

* freek/luuk will be working on wysiwyg tool coming weeks

* Silas's Concerns RE Accessibility: color contrast for erroring cell output [https://github.com/jupyter-book/myst-theme/issues/744](https://github.com/jupyter-book/myst-theme/issues/744) and scrollable regions (e.g. wide code cells) [https://github.com/jupyter-book/myst-theme/issues/743](https://github.com/jupyter-book/myst-theme/issues/743). Need help figuring out where to get started, but should be able to make the fixes easily. 
  * [bsipocz] - I also wonder if fixing this scroller issue would also help with accessibility? [https://github.com/jupyter-book/mystmd/issues/2458](https://github.com/jupyter-book/mystmd/issues/2458)

* Also interested in learning more about interactive visualizations. Discussed kernel-based ones (ipywidgets), non-kernel based ones (plotly, bokeh), iframes (embed a pre-baked visualization). also anywidget and using JS-directly (not yet available, but desired)

### Notes for Community Manager recruitment

* Proposal: [https://github.com/jupyter-governance/funding-proposals/issues/6](https://github.com/jupyter-governance/funding-proposals/issues/6)
  * Funded at 90k
* We need to know what success looks like, so that we can assess whether someone is well suited for the role
  * We're likely to get N>1 good applications!
* Paid take home assignments are a great way to actually see someone's work 
* Can we also collect examples of where they have done similar work before
  * Both as stories (behavioralish interviewing process) and as a portfolio of past work
* We need to know who is going to be part of the hiring process
  * Everyone knows everyone else - and it is very likely that the best candidates WILL be known to us!!
  * Kirstie: FINAL decision maker, chair of the committee! 
  * Yuvi: wants to be part of the process
  * Carol Willing: Yuvi would like her to be part
  * Chris Holdgraf: doesn't need to be part, we think? (ask him) (similarly not Angus as 2i2c represented already through Yuvi)
  * Suggest one of Stefan or Rowan - ask them to nominate?'
  * Min and April: both would like to help design and run the process, to be fair, inclusive \& make a good decision (neither needs to be a decision-maker) 
* What's the recruiting pipeline and timeline
  * Steps
  * When do we want to start?
  * When do we hope to finish?
  * What tools do we use for recruiting (applicant tracking system, etc?)
* How much time do we expect the person to spend on the project?
  * Can they just tell us how much time they'll spend for $90k?
*  How senior is this role? 
  * Are they doing strategy work? Are they writing reports? What percentage of their time will they spend on this effort?
  * Are they engaging with the community? Are they onboarding folks? Supporting newcomers participation?
  * We need the strategic thinker expertise - doesn't need to be super tenured 
  * Needs to wrangle technical leadership (senior, busy, cat-shaped) 
  * Confident, skilled, trusted are qualities we need to look for 
  * They need to set a direction AND go do work hands-on AND bring other people along with them - figure out what to do, do it, get others psyched to do it
* How heavily do we want to weight knowing the JH/JB tech stack? 
  * You need to understand it well enough that it's not a barrier to setting direction 
  * Needs to be empathetic to users and developers!
* As trite as "fast learner" is, the person needs to very quickly learn enough of the power dynamics of the community, enough about the people and vibes, enough about the tech stack, and enough about user experiences to have a thoughtful, trusted - lovable even - voice 
* A skill that is required is being able to montior all the different connections and communications for the projects (discord, github, zulip etc etc) and be able to direct the questions / suggestions to the right place or person.
  *  Very high trust and respect from maintainers required!
* Actions: 
  * By next collab cafe, Kirstie, April (and Min?) will draft a process
  * Yuvi will own creating a take home assignment (deadline 1-2 weeks after that)
