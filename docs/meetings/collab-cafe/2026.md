### Notes for Jupyter Book

* Injecting Javascript into sites
  * Issue tracking AnyWidget-like integration: [https://github.com/jupyter-book/mystmd/issues/2603](https://github.com/jupyter-book/mystmd/issues/2603)
  * PR: [https://github.com/jupyter-book/mystmd/pull/2602](https://github.com/jupyter-book/mystmd/pull/2602)
* Accessibility
  * Had a pass early on in the project
  * Still needs work, opportunity for someone to take a lead on
  * There are a few low-hanging issues, such as color contrast
    * Cell errors don't meet color contrast requirements
    * Scroller issue ?
  * See also Silas's notes below
* Python Theme server proof-of-concept
  * Show how a "theme" works
  * Consume AST and files and render output
  * Alternative for low-level rendering without JavaScript stack
* MEP status update
  * [https://github.com/jupyter-book/myst-enhancement-proposals/pull/37](https://github.com/jupyter-book/myst-enhancement-proposals/pull/37)
* Outputs work update:
  *  [https://blog.jupyterbook.org/posts/2025-12-17-per-output-nodes-myst-ast-v3/](https://blog.jupyterbook.org/posts/2025-12-17-per-output-nodes-myst-ast-v3/)
  * Accompanying MEP: [https://github.com/jupyter-book/myst-enhancement-proposals/pull/32](https://github.com/jupyter-book/myst-enhancement-proposals/pull/32)
* Universal AST - [https://discord.com/channels/1083088970059096114/1457711013532139551/1457711030871527664](https://discord.com/channels/1083088970059096114/1457711013532139551/1457711030871527664)
  * Proposal: [https://hackmd.io/@agoose77/HkVEefF4Zx](https://hackmd.io/@agoose77/HkVEefF4Zx)
* Extensible MyST Exporters — [https://hackmd.io/h8NTuPFBQImhCKKELOhx2g](https://hackmd.io/h8NTuPFBQImhCKKELOhx2g)

* 2026 big picture items
  * What is the most useful way for the community to help?
  * Execution initiative: [https://github.com/jupyter-book/mystmd/issues/2019](https://github.com/jupyter-book/mystmd/issues/2019)
  * We're still working on a good strategy for prioritizing and executing on issues

* Reminder: weekly work sessions (see [https://compass.jupyterbook.org/contribute/#events)](https://compass.jupyterbook.org/contribute/#events))
  * Wed 9am Pacific, and feel free to organize other sessions


* Yuvi demo: [https://github.com/yuvipanda/jupyterbook.pub/](https://github.com/yuvipanda/jupyterbook.pub/)
  * enter repo (does not need to be GH) and static files for a book are deployed (magic?)
  * yuvi has 5 hrs into this tool and wants input from JB users to know where to take it further
  * ideas:
    * from demo chat: helping with PR review, preserving older/alternative versions of books, ...
    * ability to edit/modify static files after build?
    * regarding execution of source code during book build (e.g., executing cells of a nb); is that possible, and if so how; if it needs a handoff to some compute engine how would that work?
    * use case for a user training: participants edit content, use tool, view book. should be straightforward way to see all of the "version" (perhaps by commit for new users?) and manage how many are preserved? Perhaps a sort of "refresh" button type of feature that jumps to the build from the most recent commit from a repo

* freek/luuk will be working on wysiwyg tool coming weeks

* Silas's Concerns RE Accessibility: color contrast for erroring cell output [https://github.com/jupyter-book/myst-theme/issues/744](https://github.com/jupyter-book/myst-theme/issues/744) and scrollable regions (e.g. wide code cells) [https://github.com/jupyter-book/myst-theme/issues/743](https://github.com/jupyter-book/myst-theme/issues/743). Need help figuring out where to get started, but should be able to make the fixes easily. 
  * [bsipocz] - I also wonder if fixing this scroller issue would also help with accessibility? [https://github.com/jupyter-book/mystmd/issues/2458](https://github.com/jupyter-book/mystmd/issues/2458)

* Also interested in learning more about interactive visualizations. Discussed kernel-based ones (ipywidgets), non-kernel based ones (plotly, bokeh), iframes (embed a pre-baked visualization). also anywidget and using JS-directly (not yet available, but desired)

### Notes for Community Manager recruitment

* Proposal: [https://github.com/jupyter-governance/funding-proposals/issues/6](https://github.com/jupyter-governance/funding-proposals/issues/6)
  * Funded at 90k
* We need to know what success looks like, so that we can assess whether someone is well suited for the role
  * We're likely to get N>1 good applications!
* Paid take home assignments are a great way to actually see someone's work 
* Can we also collect examples of where they have done similar work before
  * Both as stories (behavioralish interviewing process) and as a portfolio of past work
* We need to know who is going to be part of the hiring process
  * Everyone knows everyone else - and it is very likely that the best candidates WILL be known to us!!
  * Kirstie: FINAL decision maker, chair of the committee! 
  * Yuvi: wants to be part of the process
  * Carol Willing: Yuvi would like her to be part
  * Chris Holdgraf: doesn't need to be part, we think? (ask him) (similarly not Angus as 2i2c represented already through Yuvi)
  * Suggest one of Stefan or Rowan - ask them to nominate?'
  * Min and April: both would like to help design and run the process, to be fair, inclusive \& make a good decision (neither needs to be a decision-maker) 
* What's the recruiting pipeline and timeline
  * Steps
  * When do we want to start?
  * When do we hope to finish?
  * What tools do we use for recruiting (applicant tracking system, etc?)
* How much time do we expect the person to spend on the project?
  * Can they just tell us how much time they'll spend for $90k?
*  How senior is this role? 
  * Are they doing strategy work? Are they writing reports? What percentage of their time will they spend on this effort?
  * Are they engaging with the community? Are they onboarding folks? Supporting newcomers participation?
  * We need the strategic thinker expertise - doesn't need to be super tenured 
  * Needs to wrangle technical leadership (senior, busy, cat-shaped) 
  * Confident, skilled, trusted are qualities we need to look for 
  * They need to set a direction AND go do work hands-on AND bring other people along with them - figure out what to do, do it, get others psyched to do it
* How heavily do we want to weight knowing the JH/JB tech stack? 
  * You need to understand it well enough that it's not a barrier to setting direction 
  * Needs to be empathetic to users and developers!
* As trite as "fast learner" is, the person needs to very quickly learn enough of the power dynamics of the community, enough about the people and vibes, enough about the tech stack, and enough about user experiences to have a thoughtful, trusted - lovable even - voice 
* A skill that is required is being able to montior all the different connections and communications for the projects (discord, github, zulip etc etc) and be able to direct the questions / suggestions to the right place or person.
  *  Very high trust and respect from maintainers required!
* Actions: 
  * By next collab cafe, Kirstie, April (and Min?) will draft a process
  * Yuvi will own creating a take home assignment (deadline 1-2 weeks after that)
