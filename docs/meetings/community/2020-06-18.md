## Agenda items

This is what we’ll cover in the meeting (we have about 60m in total). We’ll copy the proposed agenda topics above here just before the meeting.

* Removing insensitive language from our repos
  * Originally posed by Chris here: https://github.com/jupyterhub/team-compass/issues/299
  * start work on renaming things like blacklist/whitelist
  * renaming git branches and associated tooling will be the second thing to do
  * waiting a little bit to see what GitHub and other projects are doing so that we end up doing the same thing
  * short blog post when we deprecate the old names with a timeline of how long they will continue to exist and when they will be removed
  * need to be a bit careful with dropping names because that might allow logins/repos/etc to work which were blocked
* **Min** introducing Vilde and our summer project to survey / analyze repos with repo2docker.
  * https://binderlytics.herokuapp.com/ ha a SQL version of our launch analytics if that is useful
* **Tim** "Binder button"
  * https://github.com/jupyterhub/mybinder.org-deploy/issues/1462
  * Thoughts and wisdom on injecting JS into "all" webpages?
  * How to do it?
    * Sidecar proxy in all singleuser pods?
    * modify CHP to inject things there
  * What could go wrong?
    * **Simon** My main concern is for javascript heavy apps where inserting a new DOM element could break them. In other cases it could disrupt the layout.
* **Erik** 1-2 min summary of new Z2JH developer setup
  * https://github.com/jupyterhub/zero-to-jupyterhub-k8s/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md
* Open mic
  * **Sarah** Parallelising mybinder.org deployment CI https://github.com/jupyterhub/mybinder.org-deploy/pull/1469
  * **Dan** [ContainDS Dashboards](https://cdsdashboards.readthedocs.io/) - publish Voila/Streamlit/Plotly Dashboards using JupyterHub
