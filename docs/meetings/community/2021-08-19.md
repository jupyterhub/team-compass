## Quick updates

60 second updates on things you have been up to, questions you have, or developments you think people should know about. Please add yourself, and if you do not have an update to share, you can pass.

- **Sarah:** I finally got around to opening a PR that will allow us to test PRs from forks on staging before merging, looking for reviews! <https://github.com/jupyterhub/mybinder.org-deploy/pull/2002>
- **Erik:** I've deployed Z2JH on Raspberry Pi OS cluster of computers running k3s :D

## Reports and celebrations

This is a place to make announcements (without a need for discussion). This is also a great place to give shout-outs to contributors! We'll read through these at the beginning of the meeting.

- **Poga:** [A 1-click install setup for JupterHub on AWS with AWS CDK](https://github.com/InfuseAI/primehub-aws-cdk/tree/main/extras), based on [Z2JH](https://zero-to-jupyterhub.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
  - <https://github.com/InfuseAI/primehub-aws-cdk/tree/main/extras>
  - <https://one.primehub.io/>
- **Erik:** YuviPanda's work to make yuvipanda/jupyterhub-ssh available, a package and associated Helm chart to access servers via SSH and/or to access the user servers storage with SFTP assuming it is exposed via a NFS server. Demo later.

## Agenda items

Let's collect all potential agenda items here before the start of the meeting. We will then attempt to create a coherent agenda that fits in the 60m meeting slot. If there are similar items try and group them together.

- **Simon:** [Repo2docker release](https://github.com/jupyterhub/repo2docker/pull/1067)
  - Need to decide where and how to publish Docker images now that Docker Hub automated builds have stopped
    - <https://github.com/jupyterhub/repo2docker/pull/1071> adds a GitHub workflow for publishing but we need to decide:
      - where to publish (Docker Hub, quay.io, etc)
      - If we stay with Docker Hub we have to share an API token instead of using one per repo since [free accounts only have a limited number](https://github.com/jupyterhub/repo2docker/pull/1071#issuecomment-894526696)
  - Any merges to r2d in the last few weeks have not been deployed to mybinder.org since there's no new image builds
  - What are JupyterHub/z2jh doing? Can we standardise?
    - Building and pushing manually in GHA. JupyterHub-bot (service account) has a token for auth. Do we create a Jupyter-org service account and add it? We have more maintainers than allowed already. Can't have more than a single token either.
      - lots of complexity and "crowdedness" already which makes doing anything tricky
  - we control the "jupyterhub" account on quay.io
  - no opposition to and support for moving to quay.io
    - need to work out the details of the migration, redirecting people who are using docker hub, etc
- **Simon:** [ Transfer jupyter-offlinenotebook to JupyterHub GitHub org](https://github.com/jupyterhub/team-compass/issues/437)
  - after a year or so of production use in mybinder.org
  - nice readme! great for oboarding new maintainers which is important for a move like this
  - erik asked about jupyterlab support/maintenance status of the project?
    - jupyter notebook
    - jupyter lab 2 and 3
    - supports all :D
  - can we transition this to the jupyterhub github team?
    - no objections to moving
- **Samuel:** [Start a JEP for the pluggable authenticator ?](https://discourse.jupyter.org/t/make-jupyterhub-authentication-pluggable/10122)
  - is this too technical for a Jupyter Enhancement Proposal (JEP)?
  - what (unexpected) consequences will this have? what existing things will it effect?
  - Need more ideas/understanding/discussion around what this would mean and what would change before being able to give feedback.
  - Right now it is hard to think about this right now
  - Is there a prototype/demo in a repo somewhere? This would help get the discussion started because there is something to look at
  - Several people would like to hear Min's thoughts on this
- **Erik:** Demo of [yuvipanda/jupyterhub-ssh](https://github.com/yuvipanda/jupyterhub-ssh)
  - Accessing a deployment server via SSH
  - Accessing a deployment server's storage (backed by NFS) via SFTP
  - Several minds were blown by this :D
  - See <https://github.com/yuvipanda/jupyterhub-ssh/issues/55> for rsync and scp and such support
- **Erik:** Jupyterhub org members, require 2FA
  - there are five members of the org who don't have 2FA enabled
  - support for enforcing 2FA? no opposition and a good security practice
  - ping the people on GitHub but don't need to wait forever for them to do it
  - if someone isn't super active it probably isn't a big deal if they lose access for a few days
