# Team Compass Review 
This is an issue which is opened automatically every quarter as a reminder to the JupyterHub project to review the Team Compass, maintained in this repository, and update any aspects of the documentation which need updating to reflect current project practices. 

**Why is this important?**
Making sure the projects' documentation is up to date helps with onboarding new members, maintaining governance, improving operational efficacy, and supporting institutional memory. 

# How to use 
Assign yourself to this issue, or ask other contributors to assign themselves. 
Take a section at a time and work through the checklist, checking off the different aspects on the checklist. 


## Team Information
### Team Roster
- [ ] Review the complete team member list for accuracy
- [ ] Verify that all current team members are listed with correct names and GitHub handles
- [ ] Remove team members who are no longer active (consider moving them to an "alumni" or "emeritus" section)
- [ ] Confirm affiliations are current (people change institutions)
- [ ] Check that contribution areas/emoji indicators accurately reflect current activities
- [ ] Verify the team lead designation is correct
      
### Team Structure & Governance

- [ ] Update any changed responsibilities or decision-making processes
      
**Questions to ask:**
- Have any team members stepped back or become inactive in the last quarter?

- [ ] Confirm credential and secret management processes are documented
### Documentation Links
