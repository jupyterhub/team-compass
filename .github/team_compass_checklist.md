# Team Compass Review 
This is an issue which is opened automatically every quarter as a reminder to the JupyterHub project to review the Team Compass, maintained in this repository, and update any aspects of the documentation which need updating to reflect current project practices. 

**Why is this important?**
Making sure the projects' documentation is up to date helps with onboarding new members, maintaining governance, improving operational efficacy, and supporting institutional memory. 

# How to use 
Assign yourself to this issue, or ask other contributors to assign themselves. 
Take a section at a time and work through the checklist, checking off the different aspects on the checklist. 


## Team Information
### Team Roster
- [ ] Review the complete team member list for accuracy
- [ ] Verify that all current team members are listed with correct names and GitHub handles
- [ ] Remove team members who are no longer active (consider moving them to an "alumni" or "emeritus" section)
- [ ] Confirm affiliations are current (people change institutions)
- [ ] Check that contribution areas/emoji indicators accurately reflect current activities
- [ ] Verify the team lead designation is correct
      
### Team Structure & Governance
- [ ] Review the Subproject Council membership list
- [ ] Confirm the Software Steering Council (SSC) representative is current
- [ ] Verify the term dates for any rotating positions
- [ ] Check that the description of team roles matches current practice
- [ ] Update any changed responsibilities or decision-making processes
      
**Questions to ask:**
- Have any team members stepped back or become inactive in the last quarter?
- Have we had any new contributors who should be considered for team membership?
- Do our governance structures still reflect how decisions actually get made?
- Is our SSC representative still active and attending SSC meetings?

## Meetings & Communication
### Meeting Information
- [ ] Verify meeting schedules and times are current

**Questions to ask:**

- Have we changed any meeting formats (e.g., from weekly to monthly)?
- Are newcomers able to easily find and join our communication channels?
- Have any communication platforms been deprecated or added?

## Resources & Infrastructure
### Shared Resources
- [ ] Review links to shared infrastructure and communications tools, and verify access
- [ ] Check PyPI package maintainer lists
- [ ] Verify GitHub organization permissions are current
- [ ] Review cloud infrastructure access (GKE, AWS, etc.)
- [ ] Check deployment and staging environment documentation for accuracy
- [ ] Confirm credential and secret management processes are documented
### Documentation Links
- [ ] Test all external links to ensure they're not broken
- [ ] Update links to moved or reorganized documentation
- [ ] Verify links to related project documentation (BinderHub, JupyterLab, etc.)
- [ ] Check that API documentation links point to current versions

**Questions to ask:**
- Have we added new infrastructure or services since the last update?
- Do all current team members have appropriate access to shared resources?
- Have we sunset any services that should be removed from documentation?

- Do our documented processes match what we actually do?
- Have we learned better ways to do things that should be documented?

## Project Goals & Strategy
